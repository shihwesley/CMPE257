Chaitra,The Desire,"Dont desire someone based on their attire;
For it, may be a live wire which will set your peace on fire,
That barefaced liar might be preaching to the choir,
Will eventually conspire but will never be a beautifier.
Dont be trapped, for that sweetbriar might be momentarily electrifier, 
Will gradually misfire but will never be a pacifier.",2020
Chaitra,Sky-watching,"Gazing at the star which is so far,
Praying for the healing of my scar,
Playing guitar which I bought from bazaar,
Sitting in my car which I wished was jaguar,
Dancing under the cedar,
Celebrating that the memoir
penned will win an oscar,
After which I will be travelling to the lunar;
Later realized that my day dreaming is bizarre",2022
Chaitra,Breathlessness,"I wanna live, I don't want to die
But I can't breathe, how hard should I try?!
Rich told me, love will not feed me;
And the rest told me, money can't buy happiness;
But I realized, I need no money, I need no love, I just want to survive. 
I wanna live, I don't want to die
I can't breathe, how hard should I try ?!",2021
Chaitra,Dating,"Dating is too much labour 
When you don't even know whether he is your flavor 
God, I wish he was my neighbor 
I would have known if he is a traitor 
But what if he is savour 
Things could have been in favor 
Hope he is not an engraver
Who cuts my peace with razor 
How do I decode this Cypher?!",2021
Chaitra,Dearest,"This distance has caused hindrance 
but hope not grievance,
Have no room for ignorance,
Because my admiration towards you is inÂ  abundance
I long for your acceptance 
And I hate your arrogance
I seek your assurance
but dislike your dominance
I wish to have positive covariance
which will ensure a great coexistence
Your charm is in exuberance
Between us there should never be dissonance",2020
Chaitra,Hustles of life,"My earlier try made me cry,
Which made my eyes very dry,
For my next attempt I cant afford to be shy,
Giving up is not better than the stick in eye,
I have dusted myself and stood up;
even though with a broken thigh,
It's time to get ready to fly high and my heart screams never say die,
My name is chai and my success is hidden in a bee hive.",2020
Chaitra,Befuddled,"Beloved Chitta,
You are in forlornness but
You crave for solitude.
For the place inside me where
you live all alone,
The thought of solitude renews 
the spring that never dries up.
Now that the love for solitude is so
Intense that you are baffled 
between happiness and it.",2020
Chaitra,Hope,"My Hope is a special kinda Dope
Hope, whose Sophistry I can Cope.
Not sure if emotions are like radioisotopes
But yes, They are on a tightrope
Hope, they dont find downward slope.",2020
Chaitra,Winter,"The time when rich enjoy the season and homeless struggle to keep themselves alive.

The rich for Christmas, calculate the calories with so much food on table and the poor burns the calories to put atleast a soup on the table.

The rich go out for winter shopping while the poor just rubs his palm

And like that, the world moves on, with one trying to fulfill desires and the other struggling for survival.",2021
