it, may be a live wire which will set your peace on fire,\nThat barefaced liar might be preaching to the choir,\nWill eventually conspire but will never be a beautifier.\nDont be trapped, for that sweetbriar might be momentarily electrifier, \nWill gradually misfire but will never be a pacifier.","1":"Gazing at the star which is so far,\nPraying for the healing of my scar,\nPlaying guitar which I bought from bazaar,\nSitting in my car which I wished was jaguar,\nDancing under the cedar,\nCelebrating that the memoir\npenned will win an oscar,\nAfter which I will be travelling to the lunar;\nLater realized that my day dreaming is bizarre","2":"I wanna live, I don't want to die\nBut I can't breathe, how hard should I try?!\nRich told me, love will not feed me;\nAnd the rest told me, money can't buy happiness;\nBut I realized, I need no money, I need no love, I just want to survive. \nI wanna live, I don't want to die\nI can't breathe, how hard should I try ?!","3":"Dating is too much labour \nWhen you don't even know whether he is your flavor \nGod, I wish he was my neighbor \nI would have known if he is a traitor \nBut what if he is savour \nThings could have been in favor \nHope he is not an engraver\nWho cuts my peace with razor \nHow do I decode this Cypher?!","4":"This distance has caused hindrance \nbut hope not grievance,\nHave no room for ignorance,\nBecause my admiration towards you is in\u00a0 abundance\nI long for your acceptance \nAnd I hate your arrogance\nI seek your assurance\nbut dislike your dominance\nI wish to have positive covariance\nwhich will ensure a great coexistence\nYour charm is in exuberance\nBetween us there should never be dissonance","5":"My earlier try made me cry,\nWhich made my eyes very dry,\nFor my next attempt I cant afford to be shy,\nGiving up is not better than the stick in eye,\nI have dusted myself and stood up;\neven though with a broken thigh,\nIt's time to get ready to fly high and my heart screams never say die,\nMy name is chai and my success is hidden in a bee hive.","6":"Beloved Chitta,\nYou are in forlornness but\nYou crave for solitude.\nFor the place inside me where\nyou live all alone,\nThe thought of solitude renews \nthe spring that never dries up.\nNow that the love for solitude is so\nIntense that you are baffled \nbetween happiness and it.","7":"My Hope is a special kinda Dope\nHope, whose Sophistry I can Cope.\nNot sure if emotions are like radioisotopes\nBut yes, They are on a tightrope\nHope, they dont find downward slope.","8":"The time when rich enjoy the season and homeless struggle to keep themselves alive.\n\nThe rich for Christmas, calculate the calories with so much food on table and the poor burns the calories to put atleast a soup on the table.\n\nThe rich go out for winter shopping while the poor just rubs his palm\n\nAnd like that, the world moves on, with one trying to fulfill desires and the other struggling for survival."},"Year":{"0":2020,"1":2022,"2":2021,"3":2021,"4":2020,"5":2020,"6":2020,"7":2020,"8":2021},"Poem_for_model":{"0":"do not desire someone based on their attire for it may be live wire which
