# Clustering K-means(Apply two clustering methods in your datasets) 

1. Form a Team of two to four students.

2. Leverage the ML life-cycle:

Find a business objective connected to it.

Find a data set, wrangle and prepare it.

Find what the data is saying : use unsupervised clustering algorithms to find clusters and interpret them.

2. Each student is to apply data wrangling, preparation and for clustering, k-means

Interpret the data. What story is the data telling us? What business problem can be solved using the data?

Notes: Please apply two clustering methods that covered in the lecture, you can refer the clustering methods at:

(MLFall2020)

Each member of the team will apply two algorithms, one with scikit, the other with tensorflow or pytorch.
