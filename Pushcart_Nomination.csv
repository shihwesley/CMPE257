0,Phoebe Bubendorfer,OIL SPILL,"A red-throated loon
mired in a slick of oil
strains her neck
in each effort
to lift her body
from the toxic sludge.

One last quiver
of wings.
She lowers her head
to her breast
eyes closed in
acceptance.
Rainbows in her feathers.

1,Bill Graeser,THE BURNING OF THE WHALES,"Fire never seems to mind
whether it's the curl of a candle wick
or a bed with baby sleeping.

So it was with the whales
beached in Oregon
and the not knowing
what else to do
with the corpses.

If we were but fire
we would not mind either.

But we are also water,
even one drop of which
forms a tear.

Those who were there that day,
who lit the match
and beheld the flames
on fiery wings rise,

they will never forget
the trembling of the sea
in their chest.",2022
2,John Mitchell,THE BUFFALO,"The buffalo stands still in the wind.
Staring ahead, huge, not even bothering
To guard its flanks.
Mysterious, majestic, silent.
Misplaced in this warm world,
Waiting for the next interval of ice,
Watching the horizon for the return
Of glaciers and the arctic birds,
Screaming from the cold, blue sky.

3,Lily Nelson,FEVER,"You are nine
      Lying on the front room couch
                        And time is thick like jelly
Fever has made the world soft
            And golden
                        Honey coating your skin
                  Stuck in your ears
      Heavy enough that moving feels like wading through a pool
                        Except worse
           Except slower and more tiring
                  Like the world is a blanket wrapped around your shoulders
And now the world is burning
            You can't smell the smoke
      But your skin feels like you've become a star
                  A bright heat coursing through your veins
            Flesh pasty and pale
      The world is too bright and hot for nothing to be burning",2022
4,Lucille Morgan Wilson,LISTENING TO DVORAK'S HUMORESQUE,"The fingered notes play up and down my spine
like gentle ripples in a laughing stream.
Caresses linger, freeing by design
sweet fantasies I had not dared to dream.

A swell of melody weaves shining chords
into my reverie, pulls me along
with silver strings. Such leading, peace affords.
Staccato notes, both delicate and strong,

strew in my path bright nuggets of delight:
a momentary rainbow after shower;
stars bursting through the canopy of night;
the dance of carillon bells from a tower.

The final quarter notes fall clear and sweet
and drop a host of bluebells at my feet.",2022
5,Allison Berryhill,SONNET TO MY STUDENTS ON THE FIRST DAY OF CLASS,"Come in and make a mess with all your thoughts.
Here shake them loose and spill them on the page.
Then push them, pull them, tie them into knots.
Your words are laughter, questions, hopes, and rage.
The writing in this room will echo, pound
against our heads and hearts: cacophony.
Then, crash of who we are creates a sound
From which our hearts rise up: a symphony.
For mess and noise and joyful chaos reign
In space where all experiment and try.
To set you free, I loose you from the chains,
Release you to explore your inner eye.
So, welcome. I invite you to a year
Of messy, joyful learning without fear.",2021
6,Heather Ann Clark,TURTLE SHELLS,"My therapist asks what else is on my mind.

A pithy incident, too long ago to recount
without exposing more than I wish today.

Instead, I tell her it's turtles.
Turtle shells, actually.
And how a wildlife refuge
put out a call to women
asking for the hook and loop pieces
from discarded bras. How these

garbage items are being attached
to broken turtle shells. The victims
of menacing cars barreling down the road,
but saved by the strength of their shells

and a kindly person to take them to shelter,
where wire and patience guide
the broken shell back together,

until it fuses shut again on its own.",2021
7,Jared Pearce,ILLNESS,"It's like waiting for the elevator
doors to release me, letting this
virus run its course. Nothing
will rub it out or bribe it, just
the clicking of days; like sitting

through meetings or finding
the next politician, so many
minutes have to expire, then
life can resume its function
toward beauty, rather then

waiting for the clothes to dry
or the shower to open or food
to cook or cool or be available
or the child to walk to stop walking
or the girl to love and keep loving.

8,Shelly Reed Thieman,ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF ANOTHER WINTER,"Tongue-tied with suet and peanut
butter, a quartet of nuthatches nimble
as eighth notes commune at the feeder.

Owl calls my secret name as dusk
raps his chapped knuckles
on the kitchen window.

Dog and I allow him in unshaven,
his face creased deeply
as an ancient blueprint.

A mirage of deer disappears
toward the pond while snow brushes
layers of white over lashes

of the pine bough. Tranquility
lands, light as a moth. I invite
it in for a snifter of brandy

and like the moon, learn
to harmonize with darkness.",2021
9,Erik Trilk,DAZED AND CONFUSED,"It won't be long until I'm with the moon
this summer. Bare feet whisper on midnight
grass. Drenched dazed and confused afternoons soon.
Flags furled high on the fourth. Ball caps slightly

Off-balance. Out of order. Life shut down.
Pebbles sprinkle high school bedrooms at night.
""I'll be right down,"" she smiles, fearful of sound.
Hands entwined; fingers sweat. Teenage forthright.

Midnight memories turn into dawning
suns. Iowa yawns her dawn's early sign.
Small towns reveal their majestic awnings.
Morning tiptoes through tall beams of sunshine.

A girl kisses a boy. Lips stay disposed,
smiling... until eyes are no longer closed.",2021
10,Christopher Hunter,"LOUISA, AGE 6, AT REST","Louisa alighting into place
Always dazzles me.

She twists with surpassing grace
Into an inverted curtsey.
Her arms smoothly interlace,
As she gets all topsy-turvy.
Until, in sudden about-face,

She folds her knees,
And flees.",2023
11,Susan J Koch,SOFIA,"I cannot disremember
three carefree boys
dragging a bear cub
through Macedonia Square -
a ring through its
bloodied
nose.

12,John Mitchell,NICHOLAS II,"The ghost of the Tsar walks.
He passes some Jews and Gypsies.
One curses him; another throws a rock.
Bad angels fold their wings and watch.

Choirs sang at his birth,
Armies moved at his command.
God rang the bells
When he walked into cathedrals.
But now he hears the noise from out the east
And sees the fire in the western sky.

Death crowned him at his birth,
His cousins glittered throughout Europe.
He seldom followed good advice
And did not ask permission.
He lost a navy in a foreign sea
And an army gone at Tannenberg,
But still he played the emperor.
Magnificence is blind and deaf,
And death took all his dynasty.

",2023
13,Alise Palmer,BELTANE,"A boy green shouldered, grows
like corn endlessly and over night.
There is no laying on of hands
and praying him small again. He
will not be touched like that.

His eyes are the color of home -
almond and curious with episodes
of Breughel. He wants life in
detail and spilling
from his pockets.

His laughter cannot be
attached to anything. It leaves
like silver paper geese
in shimmering specks
and fills the air
surrounding for acres
at the speed of memory.",2023
14,Rose Postma,ON TELLING MY MOTHER I AM PREGNANT AGAIN,"My mother, who spent the day after my birth trying to decide
how to tell my father she didn't want another child

but went on to have eight more, says: the doctors will tell you
the pain of giving birth is erased by hormones and endorphins

scrubbed from the slick surface of every sensory pathway
and the anterior cingulate cortex, wiped clean like

a school bus window on a thick tule fog morning
by the back of your hand, but the pain is still there

like the letters you traced with the tip of your cold finger
in the steam on the glass, waiting for your hot breath

to reveal them again and again, waiting to spell out
what agony means. The pain: it's latent like an undertow

beneath the ice on a Canadian lake, like a knot
held down by the lacquer of an oak tabletop.",2023
